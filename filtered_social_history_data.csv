which later was found to be a gastrojejunostomy during the
course of the admission."
11766,"he is currently retired, but was a former
phd professor [**first name (titles) **] [**last name (titles) 37203**] and multiple other universities
teaching business and marketing.  he has had a previous
history of tobacco as well, but quit in [**2165**].  his
cardiologist is dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) **].

ho[**last name (stitle) **] course:   the patient was admitted to the [**hospital1 1444**] on [**2184-12-8**], and
taken to the operating theater where dr. [**last name (prefixes) **]
performed a coronary artery bypass graft times four including
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery.  a right saphenous vein graft was harvested and used
as a bypass conduit to the right coronary artery posterior
descending artery, as well as the oblique marginal one and
oblique marginal three.  at the time of the operating a left
ventricular aneurysm was also found and three separate
sutures were utilized to plicate this aneurysm.  it was seen
in the anterior wall and was consistent with probable damage
that he had sustained from previous myocardial infarctions in
the [**2162**].  her pericardium was left open at the end of the
operation.  he had an arterial line and a swan-ganz catheter
used for monitoring.  two ventricular and two atrial wires
were present, as well as having two mediastinal chest tubes,
and one left pleural tube.  his mean arterial pressure coming
off of the bypass run was 60 with a central venous pressure
of 5.  his pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 9, with a
mean of 16.

he was sedated on propofol and being maintained on
neo-synephrine.  he was brought out of the operating theater
and into the cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit
where he was weaned on the night of surgery.  he did well and
was neurologically intact postoperatively.

cardiovascular wise, his neo-synephrine was weaned from a
drip of 1 mg/kg per minute down to 0 support.  after that was
weaned he was started on aspirin.  his lasix and lopressor
were subsequently held for blood pressure issues.

pulmonary wise, the patient was given chest physical therapy
and incentive spirometry.  his chest tubes remained in place.
gastrointestinal wise, he was advanced to a diabetic/cardiac
diet.  renal wise, he was making adequate urine.  his foley
catheter was left in place, and he was transferred to the
floor.

on postoperative day two, the patient was ambulating with
assistance.  he had received [**initials (namepattern4) **] [**last name (namepattern4) **] consultation who
recommended utilizing a regular insulin sliding-scale until
he was started on appropriate oral feedings, at which time
they recommended utilizing metformin 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. and
to titrate to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for blood sugar control.
additionally, they recommended that the patient receive a
dilated eye examination as an outpatient.

on the floor, on postoperative day two, the patient was doing
well until he was on the commode using the bathroom; at which
time his telemetry monitor had picked up a 32-beat run of
wide complex nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  the
patient did develop syncope as a result of this.  he was
immediately brought to the bedside.  his blood pressure at
this time was 120/70.  he was back into a sinus rhythm
immediately and was able to recover his affect and
consciousness without difficulty.

at this time, the patient had his electrolytes repleted.  he
was given empiric magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenously as well
as 2 g of calcium gluconate for an ionized calcium of 1.1.
additionally, he was given 20 meq of k-dur p.o. times one.
the patient was placed on lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

given the fact that he had his aneurysm plication, as well as
a low ejection fraction with documented 30%, a history of
mild mitral regurgitation, the electrophysiology consultation
service was consulted to evaluate the patient.  they
recommended the patient be studied outside of the 96-hour
window from perfusion, as it is typical for patient's post
coronary artery bypass graft to have nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

on the same day, postoperative day two, after the
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient ultimately
ended up in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response.  his blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s
systolic.  his heart rate was 130s to 150s.  he was given
intravenous lopressor 20 mg total over one hour which had
little effect.  he was loaded with intravenous
amiodarone 150 mg intravenously and started on an amiodarone
drip at 1 mg per hour times six hours and then changed to
0.5 mg times 18 hours.  he was ultimately transferred to the
intensive care unit for 24 hours on postoperative day days
two through three for heart rate control.  he remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the entire time and had no
further ectopy.  he actually converted to sinus rhythm once
he was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit.
however, he stayed there overnight until postoperative day
three when he was admitted back to the floor.  he was
maintained oral amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.   his lopressor
was titrated to affect, and electrophysiology recommended
that the patient undergo a formal study on [**2184-12-13**].

note, during the patient's postoperative course he remained
afebrile; however, he did have an elevated white blood cell
count on postoperative day three.  his white blood cell count
to rose to 24,000.  he had no identifiable source of
infection.  he had a chest x-ray that was completed after
removal of all of his lines and tubes, and at that time there
was no focal infiltrate.  there was evidence of bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as some
basilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  however, the
cardiac silhouette was stable with no evidence of effusion.
there was no pericardial friction rub noted.  he had no
productive sputum.  his sternal incision was clean, dry, and
intact with no evidence of erythema or drainage.  the
bilateral lower extremity saphenous vein graft harvest
incisions were also pristine and without evidence of
infection.

due to the lack of etiology for the patient's white count it
was just monitored serially, and it subsequently defervesced.
it was felt to possibly be secondary to his acute stress
reaction from the operation and the demargination phenomenon
that sometimes occurs after a bypass run.

by [**2184-12-13**], on postoperative day five, the patient
was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory where he
underwent a formal evaluation of his sa-node, and it was
found that he had a inducible av-nodal reentrant tachycardia
as well as an inducible ventricular tachycardia found in the
regions.   an ectopy site was found in the region of his
aneurysm plication.  he ultimately had an automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator placed in the left clavipectoral
fossae through the left subclavian vein with lead placements
into the right atrium and left ventricle.

the patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged
back to the floor.  over the next two days the patient
remained afebrile.  his white blood cell count serially
decreased to 15,000 from 24.  his blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine remained stable throughout his hospital course
with a discharge blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 14 and
0.8.  his discharge laboratories were significant for the
white count as mentioned, with a hematocrit of 27.9 (which
was stable), a platelet count of 502,000.  electrolytes were
within normal limits.  his temperature was 96.6 on
examination, heart rate 84 in sinus rhythm, and blood
pressure 120/42.  he was satting at 98% on 2 liters.  he was
in no acute distress.  his sternum was stable with no
drainage.  his heart was regular with murmur or friction, no
gallop rhythm.  his lungs were decreased to auscultation, but
revealed no crackles, and he did have breath sounds
throughout except at the bases.  he had a benign abdominal
examination.  his lower extremities were not edematous, and
the incision sites had steri-strips, open to air, and dry.
the left subclavian approach automatic internal
cardioverter-defibrillator implant wound was clean, dry, and
intact as well."

50% left main lesion, a 50% ostial left anterior descending
artery lesion, a 70% second diagonal lesion, a patent left
circumflex with stent, and a 40% mid right coronary artery
lesion.

a chest x-ray on [**12-10**] showed resolution of a left
apical pneumothorax, left lower lobe atelectasis, and no
effusions.

concise summary of hospital course by issue/system:  the
patient was admitted to [**hospital1 69**]
on [**2142-12-6**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times
two by dr. [**first name8 (namepattern2) **] [**last name (namepattern1) 70**].  the patient had a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.

the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the intensive care unit on levophed and propofol
infusions.

preoperative of 30% to 35% to postoperative of 45%.  the
patient was weaned off of pressors on postoperative day one.
the patient was restarted on diuretics and asthma
medications.

the patient required intermittent nebulizer treatments for
wheezing.  the patient felt that this was not significantly
from his preoperative albuterol requirements.  the patient's
blood sugar remained under good control.

on postoperative day four, the patient was transferred from
the intensive care unit to the regular floor where he was
ambulating with physical therapy.  the patient's chest tubes
and pacing wires were removed.

on postoperative day five, the patient was anxious to be
discharged to home.  the patient was able to clear a level v
physical therapy which required walking 500 feet and climbing
one flight of stairs without difficulty.  the patient did
have some exertional wheezes which responded to the use of
his albuterol meter-dosed inhaler, and it was decided that
the patient was stable for discharge to home."

""a family meeting took place on monday, [**2167-11-2**] with
palliative care, social work, the medicine team, and the
patient's husband and two daughters.  prognosis and goals of
care were discussed.  they agreed that they would be okay with
a nasogastric tube for feeding and would not like to undergo
the risk of a procedure to place a g-tube or peg-tube.  their
ultimate goal would be for the patient to return home where she
could spend time with family including her grandchildren whom
she adores greatly.  they hope for improvement in her condition
and her functionality at the rehab.  if significant sustained
progress at a rehab is not appearing likely after a trial of a
several weeks or the patient's condition begins to decline
further, they would likely consider transitioning to
comfort-oriented care at home with hospice.""
